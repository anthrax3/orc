Managing your objects (files) on the ORC network is easy! This guide will show 
you how to configure your node to expose a simple REST API that applications 
can use to upload, download, delete, and list objects you have stored in the 
network.

#### `BridgeEnabled`

Set this property to `1` to enable the local API.

#### `BridgeHostname`

Set this property to bind the service to an hostname or IP address. **It's 
important to use a loopback interface or LAN IP** otherwise an attacker may be 
able to upload and download your objects! Best to use `127.0.0.1` which is the 
default.

#### `BridgePort`

Set this property to instruct the local bridge service to bind to the given 
port. Defaults to `4445`.

#### `BridgeTempStagingBaseDir`

Set this property to instruct the local bridge service where to hold temporary 
data while objects are being uploaded to the network. Safe to leave as the 
default, which is `~/.config/orc/__bridge.staging`.

### List Objects Stored

You can get a JSON list of your objects stored in the network by sending a 
request to `GET /`.

Example:

```
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:4445 | jq
[
  {
    "id": "d049bff2-21b5-4f2f-bac3-efb3832a5afb",
    "name": "README.md",
    "encoding": "7bit",
    "mimetype": "application/octet-stream",
    "hash": "877167565af0376f2fddb170ad0483f91e9b932d72052720ae15efeb8ec2b010",
    "size": 3229,
    "status": "finished",
    "shards": [
      {
        "index": 0,
        "size": 1616,
        "audits": {...},
        "service": [
          "6ee50b070fb8ce1fcd42814d18ee10f0615c235c",
          {...}
        ],
        "contract": {...}
      },
      {
        "index": 1,
        "size": 1616,
        "audits": {...},
        "service": [
          "e34d507bf40171f1471dd1d7f41323439e36fe37",
          {...}
        ],
        "contract": {...}
      },
      {
        "index": 2,
        "size": 1616,
        "audits": {...},
        "service": [
          "cc31602c67a35a26d23d93d62bef0d6d09c89e0d",
          {...}
        ],
        "contract": {...}
    ]
  }
]
```

### Upload Objects

You can upload a file to the network my sending a multipart/form-upload request 
to `POST /`. This works the same as if using a `<input type="file"/>` on a web
page. You can also add `policy` fields to specify access policies as defined in 
[IMP-0010](https://github.com/orcproject/imps/blob/master/imp-0010.md).

Example:

```
$ curl -F "file=@README.md;filename=README.md" http://127.0.0.1:4445 | jq
{
  "id": "d049bff2-21b5-4f2f-bac3-efb3832a5afb",
  "name": "README.md",
  "encoding": "7bit",
  "mimetype": "application/octet-stream",
  "hash": "877167565af0376f2fddb170ad0483f91e9b932d72052720ae15efeb8ec2b010",
  "size": 3229,
  "status": "finished",
  "shards": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "size": 1616,
      "audits": {...},
      "service": [
        "6ee50b070fb8ce1fcd42814d18ee10f0615c235c",
        {...}
      ],
      "contract": {...}
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "size": 1616,
      "audits": {...},
      "service": [
        "e34d507bf40171f1471dd1d7f41323439e36fe37",
        {...}
      ],
      "contract": {...}
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "size": 1616,
      "audits": {...},
      "service": [
        "cc31602c67a35a26d23d93d62bef0d6d09c89e0d",
        {...}
      ],
      "contract": {...}
  ]
}
```

### Download Objects

You can download a file from the network knowing only the UUID generated by the 
local bridge service, by sending a `GET /{uuid}` request.

Example:

```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:4445/d049bff2-21b5-4f2f-bac3-efb3832a5afb >> README.md
```

### Sharing Objects

If you supplied an appropriate access `policy` field on upload, you can share a 
magnet link with others to fetch the object pointer.

Example:

```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:4445/d049bff2-21b5-4f2f-bac3-efb3832a5afb/magnet | xclip -selection clipboard
```

To fetch an object pointer shared by someone else, you can send the magnet link
and get back an object pointer with an ID you can use in the download example:

Example:

```
curl -X PUT -T "magnet:?xt=..." http://127.0.0.1:4445
```

### Destroy Objects

You can destroy an object, nullifying associated contracts, and issuing any 
final payment to farmers by sending a `DELETE /{uuid}` request.

Example:

```
$ curl -X "DELETE" http://127.0.0.1:4445/d049bff2-21b5-4f2f-bac3-efb3832a5afb
```
